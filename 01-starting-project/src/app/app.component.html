    <!-- * With this track expression we are teling Angular which unique identification criteria can be assigned by angular automatically behind the scenes to every list item ===> In this case user.id is unique identifier-->
     <!-- Angula basically connect the user.id to every list item <li> it outputs, so that every list item has different ID, and that then helps the Angular update the list if the data would change -->
