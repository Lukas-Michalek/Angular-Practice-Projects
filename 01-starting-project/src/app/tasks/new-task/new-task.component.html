<!--* The idea is essentially to emmit an event (cancel event) from new-task.component.ts when the backdrop or cancel button is clicked, which then can be handled by the tasks.component.ts, which is the component that is rendering the new-task ==> -->
<!-- @if(isAddingTask){ -->
<!--    <app-new-task /> -->
<!-- } -->
<!--* so that I can set, isAddingTask property in that tasks.component to backt to FALSE -->


<!-- Backdrop and Cancle button needs to listen for  onCancel() in new-task.component.ts -->
<div class="backdrop" (click)="onCancel()"></div>

<!-- Although creating modal through <dialog open> is not recommended it will suffice for now -->
<dialog open>
   <h2>Add Task</h2>
     
   <form>
   
    <!-- To make sure that with every keystroke the user makes in input field adequate properties stored in new-task.ts (enteredTitle, enteredSummary, enteredDate) and their values will be updated with the values entered by user  -->

    <!--* This is being done by adding special directive => 'ngModel' directive that is meant to be used with input, text area or other form related elements to help me to get access to the value enetered by the user into those elements-->

    <!-- In order to use ngModel for live tricking (or even overriding if needed) the user input,I need to use a special two-way bindig syntax => [(ngModel)] -->

    <!--! This 2 way binding syntax [()] can not be used on any property of elements instead by default no element properties are supported! ngModel however, is a directive offered by Angular which does support two- way binding  -->

    <!--* The way I can also see this ngModel directive is something that`s placed on input element to add extra features and properties to that element behind the scene  -->

    <!-- In general the idea behind the directives is that I can build things (directives), which enhance the elements they are placed on by adding extra features, extre behaviours or properties to them. -->

    <!--* Two way binding give mi access to the value entered into input field by the user whilst at the same time allowing me to write data back into this input ===> I can listen to input but also output data with same syntax -->

    <!-- In order to use ngModel, It must be registered by importing FormsModule (collection of directives and features that help me with dealing with forms and user inputs) -->

    <!--  -->
    <p>
        <label for="title">Title</label>
        <input type="text" id="title" name="title" [(ngModel)]="enteredTitle">

    <p>

    <!--! There can be only one submit button due to the way the form works and therefore any other button needs to be of type button  -->
