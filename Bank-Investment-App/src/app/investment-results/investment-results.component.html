<!-- Firstly, I need to add "Fallback text", which means that if user fails to insert input, or any fields are empty, or even if he clicks submit before populating input fields this text will be shown prompting user to populate all fields -->

<p>Please enter your values and press "Calculate"</p>


<!--* If user enters the value, table with all data will be shown  -->


<table>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <td>Year</td>
            <td>Investment Value</td>
            <td>Interest(Year)</td>
            <td>Total Interest</td>
            <td>Invested Capital</td>
        </tr>
    </thead>

<!-- I want to dynamically populate the body of the table with data from user -->
    
    <tbody>

    </tbody>
